# Catalog

Every bundle in this library, generated from the `SKILL.md` files by
`roboskillhub catalog`; a test fails when this page is out of date. The
overview has one line per bundle, and each name leads to its section: the
full description a planner reads, what goes in and comes out, what each exit
means, and what it calls.

9 tools, 68 skills, 2 policies, 1 recipe and 1 paper.

Under robots, `any` means the bundle reads the robot through `describe_*`
tools; *tuned on* names the robot its constants were measured on; **sim only**
means it reads simulator ground truth (`sim.*`) and never runs on a real robot.

Ordered centrelines of deformable linear objects — skeletonises a cable, rope or hose mask, recovers one traversal order through occlusion breaks and self-crossings (TrackDLO's chain merge), back-projects the ordered pixels through depth onto the object's axis as an arc-length-parameterised polyline, and carries a known centreline onto the next frame with motion imputed for hidden stretches, and reads off its two ends (tip position, outward direction, pixel). Use when a workflow needs an ordered centreline of a cable, rope or hose from a mask and a depth frame, must carry one through occlusion between frames, or needs where a cable's tip is and which way it points.

### predicates

judge · robots: any · tasks: pick-place, insertion, sorting · Apache-2.0 · v0.1.0 · [`SKILL.md`](tools/predicates/SKILL.md)

Geometric yes/no judgments over poses and boxes the graph already holds -- is a point inside an oriented box, does one box rest on another, are two points within a distance, is a body upright -- each returning a boolean, a verdict string a router can branch on, and the margin it was decided by. Use when a graph must choose a branch from geometry it already has (a perceived OBB, an end-effector pose), on CPU, with no model and no simulator state.

- **Functions**:
  - `predicates.point_in_obb`: Whether a world point lies inside an oriented box, and by how much.

## Skill details

### detecting-contact-from-joint-effort

perceive · robots: any · tasks: pick-place, insertion · MIT · v0.1.0 · [`SKILL.md`](skills/detecting-contact-from-joint-effort/SKILL.md) · [upstream](https://github.com/i2rt-robotics/i2rt/blob/main/i2rt/robots/utils.py)

Feels for contact without a force sensor - steps the hand along a short straight line a few millimetres at a time and, after each step, decides from proprioception whether something holds it - the joint efforts against a baseline taken in free motion along the same line (i2rt's gripper clog test, generalised to the arm) where the observation carries efforts, otherwise how far the measured tool centre lags the commanded one beyond its free-motion lag. Returns where the hand stopped and which signal fired. Use when a surface's position is known only to a centimetre or so and must be measured by touch (a table or a box floor before a grasp or a place, the top of an object, a wall before a slide), or to check that a line is clear before a move along it.

- **In**: `end` Vec3
- **Out**: `contact` bool, `signal` str, `contact_position` Vec3, `contact_point` Vec3, `travelled` float, `lag_over_baseline` float, `effort_ratio` float, `efforts_available` bool, `steps` int, `baseline_lag` float
- **Calls**: connector `robot.close_gripper`, `robot.get_ee_pose`, `robot.get_observation`, `robot.go_to_pose`, `robot.solve_ik`
- **Scripts**: [`detect_contact`](skills/detecting-contact-from-joint-effort/scripts/detect_contact.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `contact`: A step left the hand held - its lag beyond the free-motion lag over lag_threshold (3 mm), or a joint's effort residual over its threshold; contact_position is the tool centre where it stood, contact_point that pushed on by tip_reach, `signal` says which fired (lag, effort or effort+lag); the hand then backed off `backoff` (3 mm) along the line.
  - `free`: The hand reached the line's end (or the tool-centre floor) with every step tracking as in free motion; it stays there.
  - `no_signal`: Nothing usable to decide with - signal=effort with an observation that carries no efforts (nothing moved), the line too short for two free-motion samples, or the free-motion lag jumping more than lag_threshold from step to step; `detail` says which.

Read a cable's ordered 3D centreline from one RGB-D frame and keep it current across a task — seed it from an unobstructed survey, re-fit it cold whenever the whole rod is in view, and fall back to tracking the carried prior only when the fresh fit comes back short. Use when a manipulation loop needs the current shape of a deformable linear object (a cable, rope, or hose) once per step rather than every frame, from a fixed third-person camera.

Locates a language-described functional part of a rigid object or fixture from calibrated RGB-D and fits a typed loop, shaft, tip, aperture, surface, or region feature with a metric centre, axis, and radius, either inside an already-segmented parent or end to end from a described object, protruding shaft, directed tip, or lidded aperture.

Loop-head perception for pack-all / clean-all-items tasks. From ONE observation it localizes BOTH the destination container (basket, bin, box) AND the next remaining target item, using the pairwise VLM crop tournament with a container-excluding description so the target is never confused with the basket, then makes a clean found / none decision: an item was found (grasp it) or only the container remains (all items packed — exit the loop to done). Use when a workflow must pick up EVERY object and place each into a container in a loop (pack-all / clean-all-items) and each pass must reliably answer "is there still a graspable item, or are we done?" while also exposing a fresh container OBB for the downstream place. This subgraph is self-contained and takes NO inputs (inputs: {}); the container and item phrases are literal strings written inside the perception nodes, never subgraph parameters — do not declare item_name / container_name / item_description as subgraph inputs.

Hierarchical perception for subpart targeting. Detects a parent object first (DINO+VLM), crops the camera image to the parent's bounding box, then detects and segments the named subpart inside the crop (DINO + SAM3), and uncrops + fuses depth to a world-frame OBB/mask/cloud — plus the parent object's OBB and cloud for downstream placement/collision reasoning. Use when the graspable affordance is a subpart of a larger object — pan handle, drawer pull, mug rim, moka-pot handle, stove burner — where detecting the subpart at full image resolution is unreliable because it occupies few pixels.

Fast single-path 3D object perception. Runs Grounding-DINO broad detection, a pairwise VLM crop tournament to identify the target box, SAM3 box segmentation, and depth back-projection to a world-frame point cloud, finished by geometry.filter_and_compute_obb for a clean oriented bounding box, mask, and cloud. Multi-camera rigs get a verified wrist-camera fallback gate. Use when a manipulation workflow needs to localize one named object quickly — uncluttered scenes with visually distinct targets, latency-bound loops, or platforms deploying only DINO + VLM + SAM3 + geometry.

Lightweight one-shot 3D object perception. Runs Grounding-DINO broad detection, a SINGLE VLM set-of-marks letter pick over the labeled boxes, SAM3 box segmentation, depth back-projection, and geometry.filter_and_compute_obb. No pairwise tournament, no multi-view safe-gate. Returns a clean not_found output (no exception) when the VLM answers "none" or DINO emits no detections — making this the right skill for clean-all-items loops whose natural termination signal is "no more matching objects in view". Use when a multi-item loop needs a clean no-match exit, or for generic target descriptions on uncluttered scenes with reasonably sized targets.

Perceives multiple source and destination instances and resolves language-conditioned one-to-one or many-to-one correspondences.

Survey a cable-routing bench from one overhead RGB-D frame — find every station (spool, cleat) by colour, roundness and height off the work surface, fit the cable's ordered centreline through a text-prompted segmenter, derive the side each crossing owes from the instruction's alternation, and place the physical seat beside each post.

Discovers a labelled four-compartment destination from RGB-D and repeatedly perceives one remaining source object with its matching metric destination region, using an identity table the graph supplies for what each label looks like and what its graspable part is called.

Reconstructs a planner collision world from calibrated RGB-D views alone, excluding the grasp target, the robot, and a perceived fixture mask, dropping depth-edge slivers and invalid-depth sheets, and carving the free space an intentional-contact goal needs as an approach tube along a fixture axis or a corridor through a lid aperture.

Reobserves a grasped rigid object from the wrist cameras, estimates its functional feature in the TCP frame, and fits attached collision spheres, retaining the grasp-time transform at low confidence when the object is not seen.

Use when a short instruction such as "push the cube to the right", "press the button", "sweep the cable aside with the stick" or "put the plug on the board" must become one motion without a task-specific skill, with a calibrated overhead RGB-D camera and a hand that is empty.

Propose top-down grasps whose jaws close ACROSS an elongated object's short axis, derived from its oriented box. Use when the object is longer than it is wide, as the first grasp-proposal rung — a handle, a spanner, a screwdriver, a bar, a laid-down bottle — where closing along the length would put the fingers down the object and meet them on each other. Declines when the short axis is wider than the hand opens, which is the signal to try `proposing-side-grasps` rather than to re-tune this one.

Propose horizontal (side-entry) grasps swept around an object's oriented box — twelve azimuths ranked by jaw margin.

Picks world-frame spots on a named surface where a held object can be set down - asks a pointing model for points in the vacant area (RoboPoint's question to gemini-er.point) or a VLM for free tiles of a grid drawn over the image (MOKA), back-projects each through calibrated depth, keeps those whose footprint is level, flat, on the surface and clear of anything standing on it, and ranks them by free room.

Walk a ranked list of candidate grasp poses and take the first the arm can actually reach — IK solves it, the solution lands where it was asked, and (where `sim.clearance` is available) the arm is clear of the scene there.

Ranks top-down grasp points along a cable's fitted centreline that keep the fingers off its ends (a larger margin at the plug end), off hidden stretches and crossings, off tight bends, and clear of obstacle boxes, other cables and the cable's own other stretches, then checks each with robot.grasp_frame (jaws across the local tangent) and robot.solve_ik and returns the reachable ones as grasp poses, best first.

Pins one end of a cable with the support hand before any crossing is attempted — asks the support-hand planner for the anchor grasp as joint-space legs, refuses it when its worst IK error is past the limit, streams the legs, closes the jaws to the plan's own width and dwells for the fingers' travel, and carries the solved chain and grasp orientation out on the exit so later pay-outs seed from them.

Moves the hand to hover a set clearance above a target's oriented box, rising in place first and keeping the hand's current rotation, then checks from a fresh pose reading that it arrived. Use when a learned policy is about to take over and should start near the object from the rotation it was trained with, or whenever a graph needs the hand parked above an object before a step of its own; needs the target's OBB from a perception skill.

Re-perceive before another try.

Direct IK align-then-descend grasping. The gripper pre-rotates to the grasp orientation at a safe height ABOVE the target before descending straight down, avoiding the twist-while-closing failure mode of a blended rotate+descend. The grasp rotation is rebuilt so the hand's declared closing axis (robot.describe_gripper, composed by robot.grasp_frame) closes across the target's short horizontal axis, and the hover clearance is the hand's own (robot.describe_workspace) unless the workflow pins it.

Deterministic short-axis-aligned grasp with CuRobo. The grasp pose is computed geometrically (NOT sampled/scored) — the gripper approaches straight down with its finger-opening axis locked to the OBB's SHORTER horizontal axis, so the jaws close ACROSS the narrow dimension of an elongated target. Use for pan/pot handles, bottles, tools, utensils — anywhere the OBB centroid is graspable but orientation is the thing that matters. An optional offset_from_base node slides the grasp outward along the handle, clear of the heavier object body, when a second OBB of that body is wired in. A scored/sampled pose often holds at close but shears out under the lift; the short-axis pose grips the bar squarely so it survives lift + transport.

Top-down grasping via a fast axis-locked linear descend with a collision-aware cuRobo fallback. A single `grasp_descend_linear` node rises, translates over the target, and descends straight down (Z-locked, orientation held) onto the object; if the straight-line solve is infeasible (far-edge reach, no IK for the fixed wrist) it falls back to the cuRobo planner over the candidate fan.

Hands the object one arm holds to the other arm - the donor carries it to a handover point both arms reach (keeping its rotation), the receiver pre-poses back along a horizontal approach, moves in on the side of the object away from the donor's hand and closes; only when the receiver's jaw opening says it holds something does the donor open, and the hold is rechecked before and after the donor backs out. Use when a bimanual station must pass a held object between its arms (regrasp from the other side, reach a place only the other arm reaches, free the first arm), with the held object's box from a perception skill, both arms addressable by arm_id and the receiver empty.

One arm holds an object still - a top-down grasp, or its closed hand pressed down on the object's top - while the other arm does a step, then the holder checks it still holds (its jaw opening and its own pose unchanged since the hold, and optionally a re-perceived box of the object) and lets go.

Use when a pose must be hit closer than the arm's own move bound allows - a look pose, a pre-grasp or pre-insert pose, a descent near the table, or anywhere far out in the reach where a joint controller without an integral term leaves a steady error - and as a reach check whose not_reached exit means the arm is blocked, stuck or at the edge of its reach.

Finds an opening the held part or the closed fingertips can enter by probing straight down over a hexagonal grid around the opening's estimated mouth, nearest points first, stopping on contact and judging each probe by how far below the mouth the hand got - no force sensor. Use when a vertical insertion's target is known only to a few millimetres (a camera's estimate of a hole, a slot, a ring's opening, a socket), the hand already holds the part over it or is empty with the fingers closed, and the arm can stop on contact.

Streams one planned crossing leg of a cable onto a routing station, lets the rod settle, then LOOKS — segments the rod, fits its centreline and counts how much of the curve lies inside the station's seat box on the side the route requires — and reports the fraction honestly rather than assuming the crossing took.

Use when a slab, card, plate, phone or book lies flat on a table and a top-down pinch cannot reach its sides, a free edge of the support is within reach, the object's OBB comes from a perception skill, the edge from a plane or table boundary (a point, or a point and a direction, world frame), and the hand is empty.

  - `slid_not_picked`: The slide ran but the hand travelled short of it or could not lift off, or the pinch's hover was refused, or the open hand stopped more than 6 mm above the pinch height (a blade on the slab or the support), or the jaws closed on nothing (or lost it in the lift); `detail` says which. The slab may have moved; re-perceive it.
  - `unreachable`: Nothing moved the slab - its centre is not inside the edge, it is too short across the edge to overhang enough with its centre on the support, too wide for the jaws, more than max_slide from the edge, the IK preview refused the end of the slide or the pinch, the hover was refused for every rotation, or the descent behind it (push) / onto it (press) failed.

Stacks the object the hand holds centred on top of a target object - turns the hand about the vertical so the held box's faces line up with the target's, approaches above the target's top, comes straight down until the arm stops on contact, releases and retreats straight up (ManiSkill's stack-cube solution and RoboTwin's block stacking, with placing-with-contact-descent's descent in place of a move to a known height). A stop far from the target's top, a descent that meets nothing or a stop that pushed the hand sideways is routed and the object kept.

  - `misaligned`: The descent did not meet the target's top where expected - it stopped more than contact_tolerance (12 mm) above it, reached its bottom without stopping (the held object missed the top, or slid up the jaws), or stopped pushed sideways more than lateral_tolerance; the hand did not release and lifted the object back to the approach height.

Turn a body over on the surface it rests on instead of carrying it — pinch two opposite walls LOOSELY and off centre so the pads act as a pin joint, lift so the surface and gravity stand the body up on its own edge, then press it onto the surface and pull the pins toward you about whichever edge is grounded until it is just past balance, and let go.

Move the currently-held object to a destination and release. The gripper enters this subgraph holding the object; on exit the object has been placed. For a walled container (basket / bin / box / tote) the default is a straight-Z descent to inside the walls (transport_descend_linear → release); for placement ONTO a surface or into a described sub-region it computes an explicit drop pose (compute_drop → move_above → release). Use after a successful grasp when the destination has a known OBB. When the destination is a sub-region described in natural language (e.g. "the left compartment of the caddy", "to the left of the plate", "the inside of the top drawer"), an optional VLM-grounded perceive_zone state localizes the zone before the drop pose is computed. Heights derive from the perceived container and the live wrist pose rather than a resting tool height, and the top-down orientation from the hand actually on the arm (robot.grasp_frame).

Checks a target gripper pose before the arm moves - projects the pose into every camera that sees it (tool centre, open jaw line with its fingers at the hand's span, approach axis), draws it as MAESTRO's image editor does, dashes what lies behind the depth image's surface, and asks the VLM a yes/no question - is this target right for the stated intent (e.g. "grasp the cube from above")? Use when a perceived or computed grasp, place or approach pose should be sanity-checked against the scene (wrong object, wrong side, mid-air, inside the table) before committing a move, with only cameras and the hand's own description.

- **Scripts**: [`preview_target`](skills/previewing-target-overlay/scripts/preview_target.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `approved`: The VLM answered yes - on the overlay the target fits the intent (right object or part, right side, right height); `answer` is its one-line justification.
  - `rejected`: The VLM answered no; `answer` says why (wrong object, approach, height ...). Nothing moved.
  - `no_view`: No camera with RGB, intrinsics and pose has the tool centre inside its image (or in front of it), or vlm.query_yes_no raised; nothing was judged and `reason` says which.

Judge a finished cable route from a camera rather than from an evaluator — re-read the cable's centreline from the clear-view camera (tracking the carried prior when the support hand still hides one end), test that rod material lies on the owed side of every station within the seat's reach, and that the hand has left the rod. Use when a routing policy must decide for itself whether every crossing is seated and it is safe to stop, and report margins so a disagreement with a scorer is diagnosable.

- **Exits**:
  - `woven`: Every station has rod on its owed side within the seat's reach, and the hand is clear of the rod.
  - `short`: At least one station is unseated (no rod abreast of it, on the wrong side, or outside the box), the hand is still on the rod, or no rod could be read at all; `detail` says which.

Three independent checks on one grasp attempt -- that the hand arrived where it was sent before the jaws close, that the jaw gap after the close is not the mechanical stop, and that the lifted object is visible above the surface and near the hand. Use when a grasp closed on a small or thin object and the graph must know, before carrying or inserting, whether anything is actually in the gripper.

- **In**: `object_description` string

- **Exits**:
  - `verified`: The object was seen after the lift, above the surface and near the hand.
  - `not_held`: Nothing matching was seen, or what was seen stayed on the surface or far from the hand.
  - `reached`: The hand is close enough to the commanded grasp pose to have the object between the pads.
  - `missed`: The hand stopped further from the commanded pose than the object's own smallest half-extent allows.
  - `held`: The jaws closed on something -- the gap is above the mechanical stop.
  - `empty`: The jaws ran to the stop, so they closed on nothing.
  - `unknown`: The hand could not be read, which is a gap in the instrument rather than a failed grasp.

### verifying-insertion-by-probe-push

Checks whether a held part is seated after an insertion by pushing it a few millimetres further along the insertion axis (optionally also a little sideways) with a stop-on-contact move and reading where the hand stopped - no force sensor. Seated when the hand did not go further (and did not move sideways); not seated when it did. Use when an insertion, a placement into a pocket or a press-fit has just finished, the hand still holds the part, and no camera can see whether it went home.

- **In**: -

- **Calls**: connector `robot.get_ee_pose`, `robot.go_to_pose_cartesian`, `robot.move_cartesian_until_contact`, `robot.solve_ik`
- **Scripts**: [`probe_push`](skills/verifying-insertion-by-probe-push/scripts/probe_push.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `seated`: The push along the axis moved the hand less than seat_tolerance (default 5 mm), and every sideways push (when lateral_distance &gt; 0) less than lateral_tolerance; the hand went back to the start (return_to_start) and still holds the part.
  - `not_seated`: The hand went at least seat_tolerance further along the axis, or a sideways push moved it lateral_tolerance or more; `travel` / `lateral_travel` say how far. The hand went back to the start unless return_to_start is false.
  - `blocked`: No verdict - the hand's pose could not be read, the end of a push is out of reach by the IK preview, the tool-centre floor over table_z leaves no room for a push longer than seat_tolerance, or a push or the return to the start before a sideways push was refused.

Confirms from one RGB-D view that a released object went through an aperture, accepting either that it vanished into the container or that its visible centre lies below the rim within the opening's footprint, and routing not_placed when it is still visible above or beside the aperture. Use when an insertion-and-release must be checked without simulator state, after the release has completed.

- **In**: `observation` Observation, `object_description` string, `aperture_center` Vec3, `rim_z` float
- **Out**: `verified` bool, `evidence` string
- **Calls**: [`geometry`](#geometry), [`sam3`](#sam3)
- **Scripts**: [`verify_placement`](skills/verifying-placement/scripts/verify_placement.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `verified`: The object is no longer visible, or its visible centre is below the rim within the aperture footprint.
  - `not_placed`: The object is still visible above the rim or outside the aperture footprint, or too little depth was valid to confirm.

### centering-a-part-with-the-gripper

Centres a loose part between the jaws without perceiving it - closes on it, opens, turns the wrist a quarter turn about the hand's approach axis, closes again (each close squares the part up along one axis), opens and turns back; fails when the jaw gap after a close says nothing is between the pads. Use when the hand already stands around a small part whose estimated position is a few millimetres off (before a pick that must be centred, an insertion of a plug or peg, or threading a ring held in the fingers), the part is free to slide on its support, and the hand is open or empty.

- **In**: -
- **Out**: `first_width` float, `second_width` float, `turned_deg` float, `turned_by` string, `returned` bool

- **Scripts**: [`center_with_gripper`](skills/centering-a-part-with-the-gripper/scripts/center_with_gripper.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `centered`: Both closes ended on something (the jaw gap above the closed stop by more than min_held_width, or unread), the wrist turn between them arrived, and the hand opened again (kept closed with release=false); `returned` says whether it turned back.
  - `nothing_caught`: A close ended within min_held_width of the closed stop, so nothing was between the pads; the hand is open and, after the turn, turned back when return_to_start.
  - `unreachable`: Neither quarter turn arrived, by pose or by the last joint (refused, or the read-back rotation more than rotation_tolerance_deg or the tool centre more than position_tolerance off); the hand is open and was sent back to its start rotation.

Opens the gripper and drives the arm back to a joint configuration recorded earlier in the episode, then checks from a fresh observation that it arrived. Use when a graph must undo a failed attempt and retry from a known start (a grasp that missed, an insert that jammed, a policy that drifted), or hand a learned policy the start pose it was trained from, and the joint state to return to was captured earlier with a robot.get_observation tool node.

- **Scripts**: [`return_to_pose`](skills/returning-to-a-recorded-pose/scripts/return_to_pose.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `returned`: The arm stands at the recorded joints, every joint within max_error (default 0.08 rad) on a fresh observation, gripper open.
  - `not_returned`: The move was refused or failed, or a joint ended more than max_error off; `detail` says which.

Checks whether a subtask is done from the latest frame of every camera at one moment - sends them to a VLM with the Gemini Robotics SDK's four guided questions (object states, relations, required end state, differences) and reads its "FINAL ANSWER yes / no", once or polling fresh frames until yes or a timeout. Use when a graph needs a yes/no "is &lt;subtask&gt; done now?" gate after a step or while a policy runs, with only cameras and no frame from before the step; use judging-step-with-before-now-vlm instead when the decision needs a BEFORE frame or a recovery choice.

- **Scripts**: [`detect_success`](skills/detecting-subtask-success/scripts/detect_success.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `succeeded`: The VLM's reply ended in FINAL ANSWER yes for the latest frames (on the first check, or on any check before timeout_s).
  - `not_yet`: Asked once (timeout_s 0) and the reply was FINAL ANSWER no, or had no FINAL ANSWER even after the follow-up (read as no, as upstream did).
  - `timed_out`: timeout_s &gt; 0 passed without a yes; `checks` replies were all no or unparsed.
  - `no_view`: Nothing was judged - no camera had RGB in any observation, or every vlm.query call raised; `reason` says which.

Judges the current subgoal of a task from camera frames taken before the step and now - sends the BEFORE and NOW frames of each camera, the task, the subgoal and the subgoals after it to a VLM that returns a status (complete / in_progress / failure) and an action (next / continue / replan / grasp_tool / place_tool), and routes on the action. Use when a graph must decide after (or during) a step whether to advance, keep going, replan, or recover a wrong object or a wrong destination, with only cameras, after capturing a robot.get_observation before the step.

- **In**: `before` Observation, `task` string, `subgoal` string

- **Scripts**: [`judge_step`](skills/judging-step-with-before-now-vlm/scripts/judge_step.py)
- **Exits**:
  - `complete`: The VLM chose "next" - clear visual evidence in NOW that the subgoal is done (its object at its destination).
  - `in_progress`: The VLM chose "continue" - not done yet but still achievable, including not started; also any action outside recovery_mode's vocabulary.
  - `failed`: The VLM chose "replan" - dropped, stuck, no visible progress, or the plan no longer fits the NOW scene; `reason` says which.
  - `wrong_object`: The VLM chose "grasp_tool" - the hand holds or is closing on an object other than the subgoal's; `grasp_target` names the right one.
  - `wrong_destination`: The VLM chose "place_tool" - the held object is heading to or was released at another destination; `place_destination` is a freeform phrase for the right one.
  - `no_verdict`: No camera has RGB in both BEFORE and NOW, vlm.query raised, or its reply had no JSON; nothing was judged (VoLoAgent continued in this case).

Run the MolmoAct LIBERO checkpoint (allenai/MolmoAct-7B-D-LIBERO-0812) as a closed-loop VLA policy for the dexterous pick-and-place segment of a task. Drives a Franka Panda in the LIBERO/robosuite OSC_POSE action space from agentview + wrist cameras, served behind a vLLM-style script speaking the openpi websocket protocol; the policy server is the bundle's own preset (no policy_id). Reads the graph-scoped observation_stream each window and terminates on a gripper open→close→open cycle, a VLM yes/no check, or max_windows. Use when a pick/place (or pick-and-drop-in-container) segment on tabletop rigid LIBERO objects is delegated to a learned policy — best steered (perceive + hover above the target) first; this is the MolmoAct alternative to pi05-libero for the same task family. NOT for deformables/cloth folding, articulated objects, non-Franka embodiments, or tasks outside the LIBERO pick-place distribution.
